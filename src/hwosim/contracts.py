"""Contract types that flow across seam boundaries, in one namespace.

Seam implementations declare what they consume and produce as strings naming
public types ("hwosim.SummaryDataset", "planit_py.Action"). Those strings are
resolved to classes here, and compatibility on a dataflow edge is plain
nominal subtyping: an edge is wired correctly when some produced type is a
subclass of some consumed type.
