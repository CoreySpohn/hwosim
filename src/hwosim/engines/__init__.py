"""Engines: one run callable per outcome operator.

The operator vocabulary is open, and this registry is where it lives: an
engine is a callable ``(mission, *, seed, **options) -> YieldSummary``, keyed
by the operator name a configuration requests. There is no engine class
hierarchy because operators genuinely differ in control flow (a stochastic
event loop, a deterministic belief recursion, a vectorized closed-form
integral cannot stand in for one another behind a shared signature); the
shared surface is the report schema they all emit.

A genuinely new evaluation semantics enters as one new module registering
one new operator name; nothing else in the package enumerates operators.
