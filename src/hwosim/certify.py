"""The certification seam: when does an accumulating result count.

A certificate is a persistent per-target state that hardens as evidence
accumulates and gates what the mission announces; it is distinct from any
score a policy uses to rank actions, and the two are never converted into
each other. One certificate definition supports up to three evaluations,
matching the outcome operators: update against realized data, propagate
against predictive moments, and integrate to a certification probability.
