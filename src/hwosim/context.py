"""The observing-context seam: what the agent may know about observability.

A context provider assembles the :class:`planit_py.vocabulary.ObservingContext`
record the policy consumes: which targets are observable now, and what it
costs to get to them. The reference geometry-backed provider (keepout,
visibility windows, slew) arrives with the orbital-mechanics adapter; further
constraint families (thermal, communications, operations) enter as more
registry entries on this seam, never as signature changes.
