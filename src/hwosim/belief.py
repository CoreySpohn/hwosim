"""Mission belief containers.

The belief is everything the agent may see: per-target posteriors,
accumulated observation records, and certificate states, plus reserved slots
for the shared population block and the instrument block so the container
does not need redesign when those land. The drawn truth is never part of the
belief; the only bridge between them is the observation function.

Updates are pure: every method returns a new container and leaves the
original untouched, so belief snapshots are free.
