"""Compile the declarative layer into runnable stacks.

``build`` resolves a specification and configuration through the registry
into live objects whose continuous parameters are pytree leaves. Nothing
downstream of it ever reads configuration; nothing upstream of it touches
JAX.

Truth and model sides compile into two distinct types, and that distinction
is the firewall: only the observation function is typed to accept a
:class:`TruthStack`, so the drawn truth can never leak into policies, belief
updates, or certification by construction rather than by discipline.
