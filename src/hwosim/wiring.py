"""Configuration validation: typed ports, operator support, calibration flags.

A configuration is checked in three independent families before anything
runs: every chosen implementation must exist and be available, must support
the run's outcome operator, and every data-plane edge between chosen seams
must be type-compatible (some produced contract type a subclass of some
consumed one). Failures name both sides and the registered alternatives that
would be compatible, so the report doubles as compatibility documentation.

Truth and model sides are validated independently whenever a configuration
deliberately mismatches them; a clean configuration with no model overrides
is checked once.
