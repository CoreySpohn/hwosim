"""Accounting: the named-resource ledger and the reference cost model.

The ledger charges whatever named resources the mission specification
budgets; time ("time_d") is the universal resource, and further resources
(consumables such as retargeting fuel) are new ledger keys, not new
machinery. The cost-model protocol itself belongs to the scheduling
vocabulary (one instance shared by agent and environment); this module holds
the environment-side pieces: the ledger and the reference implementation.
