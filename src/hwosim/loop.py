"""The event-driven mission loop.

The loop is plain Python by design: it has data-dependent control flow,
variable-length logs, and heterogeneous per-target work, so the hot paths
live inside the seam implementations (which are free to JIT) rather than in
a compiled whole-mission graph. Ensemble parallelism lives at the process
level.

The certificate maintained by the loop is stored under the name
``"detection"``; richer certificate vocabularies arrive with the
specification's certificate definitions.
