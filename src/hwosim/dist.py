"""The predictive-distribution waist.

Every measurement model returns a predictive distribution over its dataset;
what a run does with that distribution is the outcome operator. The sampling
engine draws from it against a drawn truth, the belief-space engine pushes
its moments, and the closed-form engine integrates functionals against it.
One distribution type serves all three, and an implementation that cannot
support a method raises :class:`hwosim.errors.UnsupportedOperator`; the
declared capability lives in registry metadata and is checked at
configuration-validation time, never discovered mid-run.

Method names deliberately mirror the prior layer of the inference library
(``sample``, ``log_prob``) so likelihood factories and belief code read the
same on both sides of the waist.
